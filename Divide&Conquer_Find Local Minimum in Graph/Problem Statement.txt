Suppose you are given an n * n grid graph G. (An n * n grid graph is just the adjacency graph of n * n chessboard. To be completely precise, it is a graph whose node set is the set of all ordered pairs of natural numbers (i, j), where 1 ≤ i ≤n and 1 ≤ j ≤n; the nodes (i, j) and (k, l) are joined by an edge if and only if |i-k| + |j-l| = 1.)  
Each node v is labeled by a real number xv; you may assume that all these labels are distinct. Show how to find a local minimum of G using only O(n) probes to the nodes of G. (Note that G has n2 nodes.)
